# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I was born and studied in Yekaterinburg. I lived in Saint Petersburg for 3 years. Now I'm living in Belgrade.

Curently, I am engaged in the development of a payment system, focusing on its reliability.
Previously, I spent four years developing frontend, backend and infrastructure for autonomous cars and robots.
Prior to that, I was involved in educational projects aimed at school and university students, and have taught at ITMO and Ural Federal University.
