# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I was born and studied in Yekaterinburg. I lived in Saint Petersburg for 3 years. Now I'm living in Belgrade.

I'm a developer who enjoys working with Go and Python for backend development, and TypeScript with React for the frontend.
I also have hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure, especially with AWS and Yandex Cloud.
I've used Terraform a lot and know how to make it work efficiently for large teams.

Curently, I am engaged in the development of a payment system, focusing on its reliability.
Previously, I spent four years developing frontend, backend and infrastructure for autonomous cars and robots.
Prior to that, I was involved in educational projects aimed at school and university students, and have taught at ITMO and Ural Federal University.
